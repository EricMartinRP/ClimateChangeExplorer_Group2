# ClimateChangeExplorer_Group2

This Dataset Explores average daily precipitation, wind speed, and max and min temps. 

If you want to test just the site itself, please use the folder called "PlotlyCodeOnly"

If you are able to follow the instructions on how to set up the mongoDB, then feel free to use the folder called "FinalVersion"

- In order to create the mongoDB, please use MongoDBCompass to set up a database called "climate" with a collection also called "climate"
- within that collection, save the file called "Averages.json" into the collection before running the app.py file
- The MainCode file contains the CSS file, so we have kept that where it is an not renamed the folder.

Other data files are not relevent to the project, but were kept for future reference
